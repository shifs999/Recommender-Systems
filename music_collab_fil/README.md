# Music Recommendation System (Collaborative Filtering)

A sophisticated music recommendation system that uses collaborative filtering algorithms to suggest artists to users based on their listening history and the preferences of similar users.

## Features

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends music artists based on user listening patterns
- **Implicit Feedback Processing**: Works with listening counts rather than explicit ratings
- **Alternating Least Squares (ALS)**: Advanced matrix factorization algorithm for recommendations
- **Sparse Matrix Optimization**: Efficiently handles large, sparse datasets
- Handles 1,892 users and 17,632 artists efficiently
- Uses sparse matrices to minimize memory usage

## Dataset

This system uses the **Last.fm dataset** containing:
- **1,892 users** with listening history
- **17,632 artists** in the database
- **92,834 user-artist listening relationships**
- **Social network data** (user friendships)
